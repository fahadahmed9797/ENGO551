# Purpose
This project was started as a joke I made with a friend but decided to push through with the idea since I found it funny. It is a site for canine dating profiles and more specifically contains the profiles of 3 different dogs.

# Contents

The index.html file consists of the main page of the website and what its contents are
The Doug.html file contains a dog named Doug's dating profile. It contains three images of the dog and some text describing what he is like and what he is looking for.
The Paul.html file contains a dog named Paul's dating profile where he has three images and some text describing his personality.
The Pug.html file is more of the same. It includes a dog named Pug's profile. But here there is a table with some reviews from dog ladies of what he is like!
The img folder contains the 10 images that were used throughout the website for the dog profiles
The styles.scss file contains the styles that were applied to all html pages.
